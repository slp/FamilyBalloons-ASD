# FamilyBalloons-ASD
FamilyBalloons-ASD is a prototype of a balloon popping game which integrates a mechanic to motivate interpersonal interaction on children (ages 2-5) with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

After a configurable number of balloons have been popped, the game will pause and present an image of a family member, announced also with a digitalized voice. The game is resumed after a double or triple tap (also configurable, the child shouldn't be able to unlock the game themself) on the screen border.

This game mechanic intends to motivate the child to look for that particular family member to give them the tablet or smartphone with the game, who will unlock it and return the device to the child. Additional requirements, like eye contact or (non-)verbal interaction can also be easily introduced during this exchange.
